Predicting Used Car Price
</p>

The idea comes from a friend who is a Car Salesman. We want to provide him to find the best price for cars so he can sell the car with more profit using data science. Our hypothesis is that the car price can be affected by how much the car is consuming the fuel, the higher it consumes, the higher the price and the lower it consumes, the cheaper the price. It can affect the sale price for the salesman.

A discussion among individuals in the team has been discussed and decided to use 3 models such as Decision Tree, Linear Regression, and K Nearest Neighbor Regression to help solve the problem. With Decision Tree, the accuracy is impressive with 92.6% accuracy and also the Mean Absolute Error with 16.7%. The Mean Squared Error also returned with a great number of 27.5%. For the Linear Regression, the accuracy of it is quite high with 76.2% and for the Mean Absolute Error is quite high which is 28.2%. Also for the Mean Squared Error it returned with 43.1%. Last but not least is the KNN Regression with the highest accuracy number of 93.9% and for the Mean Absolute Error returned with 15.4%. Lastly, the Mean Squared Error returned with a good percentage of 24.1%. Therefore, we can safely say that the best regression model is KNN Regression.
